# Calendars manager

Benzinga provides API for querying structured data for conference calls, dividends, earnings (and future earnings dates), economics, pharmaceutical announcements, guidance, IPOs, secondary offerings, ratings, M&A activity, retail sales, and splits.

There is a separate manager and module for each calendar resource, for example for conference calls:

```ts
import { ConferenceCallsManager } from '@benzinga/calendar-conference-calls-manager'
```

## Getting started

As with other managers, you must use a session to obtain an instance of a calendar manager:

```ts
import { createSession } from '@benzinga/session';
import { ConferenceCallsManager } from '@benzinga/calendar-conference-calls-manager';

const session = createSession({
  'benzinga-authentication': {
    apiKey: '<YOUR BENZINGA API KEY GOES HERE>'
  }
});

const manager = session.getManager(ConferenceCallsManager);
```

After that you may query data. All calendars share the same input parameters, that can be used for filtering data, and also the same name of methods:

* `ConferenceCallsManager` has `getConferenceCalls(params)` method
* `EconomicsManager` has `getEconomics(params)` method
* etc...

Example of selecting second page of data, filtered by symbols and date up to 20th January 2022:

```ts
const calendarDataResponse = await manager.getConferenceCalls({
  page: 1,
  symbols: ['AAPL', 'MSFT'],
  dateTo: '2022-01-20'
});

if (calendarDataResponse.err) {
  //handle error
} else {
  console.log(calendarDataResponse.result);
}
```

Some calendars may add additional filtering params, for example IPO:

```ts
await ipoManager.getConferenceCalls({
  page: 1,
  symbols: ['AAPL', 'MSFT'],
  dateTo: '2022-01-20',
  ipoType: 'Ordinary Shares'
});
```
